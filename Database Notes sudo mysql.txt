#Important Notes :

User Table
-user_id links each driver to a user account.
-status keeps track of whether the driver is available, on a trip, or inactive.
-

Drivers  Table 
How it works
-user_id links each driver to a user account.
-status keeps track of whether the driver is available, on a trip, or inactive.
-FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id):
-This ensures that the user_id in the drivers table must exist in the users table.
-It prevents inserting a driver who doesn't have a corresponding user account.
 ON DELETE CASCADE:
-If a user account is deleted from the users table, MySQL will automatically delete the  corresponding driver record in the drivers table.
-This prevents orphaned records (drivers with no associated user).

Rides Table 
-rider_id: The user who requested the ride (linked to users).
-driver_id: The driver assigned (linked to drivers).
-It's nullable because a driver is assigned later.
 ON DELETE SET NULL: If a driver account is deleted, their rides remain but without an    assigned driver.
-status: Tracks the ride progress (requested, in progress, completed, etc.).
-fare: Stores the ride cost once calculated.
-completed_at: Stores when the ride ends (default NULL).


Payment Table 
-ride_id: Links to the rides table (each ride should have one payment).
-user_id: The rider making the payment.
-amount: The fare amount charged.
-payment_method: Supports card, cash, or wallet.
-status: Tracks the payment status (pending, completed, failed, refunded).
-transaction_id: Stores the payment gateway transaction ID (nullable, since cash might not have one).
-ON DELETE CASCADE: If a ride or user is deleted, their payments are also deleted.


Notifications Table 
-user_id: The user (rider or driver) who will receive the notification.
-message: The actual notification message.
-notification_type: Specifies the type of notification (ride_update, payment_confirmation, system_message).
-status: Tracks whether the notification is unread or read.
-sent_at: The timestamp when the notification was sent.
